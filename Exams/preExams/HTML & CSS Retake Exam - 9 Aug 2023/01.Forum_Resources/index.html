                    Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do that,
                    but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.

                    Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the
                    effort to become the best of which you are capable.

                Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual
                accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain
                uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company
                work, a society work, a civilisation work.
